HSV Add Ino\medskip
\par
\normalsize
Adds the values of the specified channel of the image connected to the Noise port,\par 
to the Hue, Saturation, Value, or Alpha channels of the image connected\par
to the Source port.\\
\par
The specified channel of the image connected to the Reference port will determine\par
the intensity of the effect.\\
\\
-{-}- \ Inputs \ -{-}-\\
Source\par
Connect the image to be processed.\\
Noise\par
Connect the image to be added to the source image.\\
Reference\par
Connect the image for setting the intensity of the effect.\\
\\
-{-}- \ Settings \ -{-}-\\
From RGBA\par
Specify which channel to use from the image connected to the Noise port.\par
Choose from one of the \textquotedbl Red\textquotedbl, \ \textquotedbl Green\textquotedbl, \ \textquotedbl Blue\textquotedbl  \ or \textquotedbl Alpha\textquotedbl \ channels.\par
The default value is \textquotedbl Red\textquotedbl .\\
\\
Offset\par
An offset for the original pixel values of the image connected to the Noise port.\par
Pixel values for 8 or 16bits images are values ranging from 0 to 1,\par
you can specify an offset between -1.0 and 1.0.\par
When the pixel value is the same as the one specified here it will not change.\par
The rest of the pixel values will change depending on their magnitudes.\par
The default value is 0.5.\\
\\
Hue\par
It specifies the intensity of the Hue change.\par
The Hue value will scale around the Offset value.\par
You can use a value from -1.0 to 1.0.\par
The image Hue will not change when the value is 0.\par
The default value is 0.0.\\

\\
Saturation\par
It specifies the intensity of the Saturation change.\par
The default value is 0.0.\par
Other options are the same as for \textquotedbl Hue\textquotedbl .\\
\\
Value\par
It specifies the intensity of the Value change.\par
The default value is 0.25.\par
Other options are the same as for \textquotedbl Hue\textquotedbl .\\
\\
Alpha\par
It specifies the intensity of the Alpha change.\par
The default value is 0.0.\par
Other options are the same as for \textquotedbl Hue\textquotedbl .\\
\\
Premultiplied\par
When ON, the image will be processed as if having a Premultiplied Alpha channel\par 
(Alpha value already multiplied by RGB channels).\par
If image is not premultiplied, the image may not look correct.\par
The default setting is ON.\\
\\
Reference\par
Specify which channel to use from the image connected to the Reference port to\par 
drive the intensity of the effect.\par
Choose from Red/Green/Blue/Alpha/Luminance.\par
Choose Nothing to disable the effect.\par
The default value is \textquotedbl Red\textquotedbl .
